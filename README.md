# logo-ls

This is a fork of the original [logo-ls repository](https://github.com/Yash-Handa/logo-ls).

The original repository seems to have been abandoned in early 2021.

I have since fixed a few bugs, added more eye candy to my taste, and updated the repo to support the new Nerd Font. Just decided to finally fork it and commit my local changes lest they get lost.
